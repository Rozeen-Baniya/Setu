> **Setu** — Nepali Sign Language (NSL) translating app  
> _Status: 🚧 In Development (Web + Mobile)_

---

## 📖 About
Setu is a cross-platform project (web and mobile) that aims to bridge communication between Nepali Sign Language users and non-signers by providing real-time translation between NSL and Nepali (and eventually other languages). The project is currently under active development. We hope to bring this to you very soon.

## 🚀 Current status
- Core idea and UX sketched.
- Prototyping of recognition & translation pipeline underway.
- No public release yet — this repository contains work-in-progress code, experiments, and notes.

## 📱 Platforms
- **Web**: Responsive web app for browsers.
- **Mobile**: Native-like mobile app (planned: Android & iOS).

## 🎯 Key goals
- Real-time NSL recognition from camera input.
- Accurate mapping from NSL gestures to Nepali text & speech.
- Two-way translation where text/voice input maps to animated NSL guidance.(Future Upgrade)
- Privacy-first design (on-device processing where possible).

## 🗺 Roadmap (high level)
1. Research & dataset collection (NSL corpora, video samples).
2. Prototype: pose / gesture detection + simple mapping engine.
3. Improve accuracy with model training and dataset augmentation.
4. Build web demo (camera input → live captions).
5. Mobile app (camera + offline inference).
6. Localization, accessibility testing, community feedback.

## 🤝 How to help / Contribute
- Report issues or open feature requests.
- Share NSL dataset samples (with consent) or help with annotation.
- Help implement front-end components, mobile UI, or model training.
- See CONTRIBUTING.md (coming soon) for guidelines.

## 📜 License & Code of Conduct
- License: TBD (will be added soon).
- We aim to be open and community-driven — Code of Conduct will be included in the repo.
